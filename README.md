Binary Search Tree Demo
Breadth-first search

Advantages of BFS:

1. The solution will definitely found out by BFS If there is some solution.
2. BFS will never get trapped in a blind alley, which means unwanted nodes.
3. If there is more than one solution then it will find a solution with minimal steps.

Disadvantages Of BFS:
1. Memory Constraints As it stores all the nodes of the present level to go for the next level.
2. If a solution is far away then it consumes time.

Application Of BFS:
1. Finding the Shortest Path.
2. Checking graph with petiteness.
3. Copying Cheney's Algorithm.

Depth-first search

Advantages Of DFS:
1. The memory requirement is Linear WRT Nodes.
2. Less time and space complexity rather than BFS.
3. The solution can be found out without much more search.

The disadvantage of DFS:
1. Not Guaranteed that it will give you a solution.
2. Cut-off depth is smaller so time complexity is more.
3. Determination of depth until the search has proceeded.

Applications of DFS:-
1. Finding Connected components.
2. Topological sorting.
3. Finding Bridges of the graph.
